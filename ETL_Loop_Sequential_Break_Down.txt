Sure, let's break down the code piece by piece to understand its functionality.

### Imports
```python
import pyodbc
import pandas as pd
import boto3
from io import StringIO
import time
```
- **pyodbc**: Used to connect to and interact with the SQL Server database.
- **pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library for Python. Used to handle and manipulate the data retrieved from the database.
- **boto3**: The AWS SDK for Python, used to interact with AWS services such as S3.
- **StringIO**: A module from the io package that allows for string buffer manipulation, enabling data to be written to a string buffer as if it were a file.
- **time**: A module providing various time-related functions.

### Database and AWS S3 Parameters
```python
# Database connection parameters
server = 'localhost'  # Replace with the SQL Server name or IP address
database = 'AdventureWorksDW2022'  # Database name
driver = '{ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server}'  # Ensure the correct ODBC driver is installed

# AWS S3 parameters
s3_bucket_name = 'rytualetlprojectbucket'  # S3 bucket name

# AWS Region
aws_region = 'us-east-2'  # AWS region
```
- These parameters define the connection details for the SQL Server and the AWS S3 bucket.

### Tables and File Numbers
```python
# List of tables to extract data from
tables = ['DimAccount', 'DimDepartmentGroup', 'DimEmployee', 'DimGeography', 'DimOrganization', 'DimProduct']

# Keep track of file numbers for each table
file_numbers = {table: 1 for table in tables}
```
- **tables**: A list of table names from which data will be extracted.
- **file_numbers**: A dictionary to keep track of the sequential file numbers for each table.

### ETL Process Function
```python
# Function to perform the ETL process for a given table
def etl_process(table, file_number):
    # SQL query to extract data
    sql_query = f"SELECT * FROM {table};"

    # Connect to SQL Server and fetch data
    print(f"Connecting to SQL Server to fetch data from {table}...")
    conn = pyodbc.connect(f'DRIVER={driver};SERVER={server};DATABASE={database};Trusted_Connection=yes;')
    print(f"Executing query for {table}...")
    data = pd.read_sql(sql_query, conn)
    print(f"Data fetched successfully from {table}.")
    conn.close()

    # Convert DataFrame to CSV
    csv_buffer = StringIO()
    data.to_csv(csv_buffer, index=False)

    # Define S3 key with sequential numbering
    s3_key = f"data/{table}_currency_data{file_number}.csv"

    # Upload to S3
    print(f"Uploading data to S3 for {table} as {s3_key}...")
    s3_client = boto3.client('s3', region_name=aws_region)
    s3_client.put_object(Bucket=s3_bucket_name, Key=s3_key, Body=csv_buffer.getvalue())
    print(f"Data has been uploaded to S3 successfully for {table}.")
```
- **etl_process**: A function that takes a table name and a file number as arguments and performs the ETL process.
- **sql_query**: A SQL query to select all data from the specified table.
- **pyodbc.connect**: Connects to the SQL Server using the provided connection parameters.
- **pd.read_sql**: Executes the SQL query and fetches the data into a pandas DataFrame.
- **StringIO**: Used to create an in-memory string buffer to hold the CSV data.
- **data.to_csv**: Converts the DataFrame to a CSV format and writes it to the string buffer.
- **s3_key**: Defines the S3 object key (file path) with sequential numbering.
- **boto3.client**: Creates an S3 client.
- **s3_client.put_object**: Uploads the CSV data to the specified S3 bucket and key.

### Main Loop
```python
# Loop to run the ETL process for each table every 3 minutes for 12 minutes
start_time = time.time()
end_time = start_time + 12 * 60  # Run for 12 minutes

while time.time() < end_time:
    for table in tables:
        etl_process(table, file_numbers[table])
        file_numbers[table] += 1
    time.sleep(3 * 60)  # Wait for 3 minutes before the next run

print("ETL process completed.")
```
- **start_time**: The current time when the script starts.
- **end_time**: The end time calculated as 12 minutes from the start time.
- **while time.time() < end_time**: A loop that runs until the current time exceeds the end time.
- **for table in tables**: Iterates over each table in the tables list.
- **etl_process(table, file_numbers[table])**: Calls the ETL process for the current table with its current file number.
- **file_numbers[table] += 1**: Increments the file number for the current table.
- **time.sleep(3 * 60)**: Waits for 3 minutes before starting the next iteration of the loop.

The script ensures that the ETL process is executed for each table every 3 minutes, with each output file having a unique, sequential name.
